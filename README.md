## Preface

The app-making process for the iOS ecosystem relies on a special, yet easy to learn paradigm for creating mobile apps. Developers are challenged to provide their users with fun, joyful, and memorable experiences.

In Friday's session, we presented Apple's approach to building games using the [SpriteKit Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SpriteKit/Reference/SpriteKitFramework_Ref/).
